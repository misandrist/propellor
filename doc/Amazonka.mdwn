# Amazonka Support

[Amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka) is a comprensive set of
libraries for managing AWS services. Integrations efforts by
[Evan Cofsky](https://github.com/misandrist/propellor/tree/Amazonka)] will
mostly focus on what he needs at the moment, and then expand outwards from
there.

# EC2 Instance Provisioning

Obviously,
[configuring EC2 instances](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-ec2)
will be pretty important, so he'll start there.

Integrating the metadata from these with
[VPCs](http://brendanhay.nz/amazonka-doc/amazonka-ec2/Network-AWS-EC2-CreateVPC.html)
for addressing and routing will be a pretty compelling thing, too, but I'm not
at all sure how that will work (yet).
